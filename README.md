## Pi.java  
calculates the value of pi by creating random points inside a unit square. The point has a Pi/4 chance of being inside of a unit circle inside of the unit square. We use the property to calculate pi. The longer it runs, the closer we get to the value of pi.

Relies on uniform distribution of java.util.Random
